## Hi there 👋

### About Me:
#### Curiosity, creativity, and code — that's my world!

As a Master's graduate in Applied Data Analytics, I thrive on solving complex problems with data-driven insights. From building healthcare chatbots using NLP to creating recommendation engines and implementing intelligent data workflows, I enjoy blending Python, PySpark, and machine learning to make an impact.

Whether it's crafting ETL pipelines with PostgreSQL, leveraging Power BI for real-time visualizations, or scaling models with Databricks, I’m all about driving efficiency and unlocking hidden value in data. When I’m not busy turning raw data into actionable insights, you can find me learning new AI techniques or exploring the endless possibilities of data science.
