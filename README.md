# 👋 Hi, I’m Nivedita Sureshkumar  
**Junior Business & Data Analyst | Finance • Healthcare • AI**

Thanks for stopping by my profile! I’m a passionate Data Analyst who thrives on transforming messy data into actionable insights and visual stories. With experience spanning finance, healthcare, and AI, I enjoy solving complex problems and driving smarter decisions through data.

As a Master's graduate in **Applied Data Analytics**, I bring a strong foundation in statistical modeling, data pipelines, and machine learning. Whether it's crafting NLP-powered healthcare chatbots, building recommendation engines, or streamlining workflows with PySpark, I’m always focused on impact.

I love working with:
- **ETL pipelines** using PostgreSQL and DBT
- **Interactive dashboards** in Power BI and Tableau
- **Scalable models and workflows** on Databricks and AWS

When I’m not analyzing data, you’ll find me exploring cutting-edge AI tools or fine-tuning my next ML project.
